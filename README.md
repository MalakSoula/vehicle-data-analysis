# Features
1. Data cleaning (handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns, simplifying categorical data).
2. Outlier detection and removal using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
4. Answering business questions:
   - Top manufacturers and models.
   - Average prices by manufacturer, model, and other attributes.
   - Relationships between mileage, condition, and price.
